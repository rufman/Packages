Sublime Text 2 Package for Java Velocity Syntax
====

This is tweaked version of subtleGradient's excellent TextMate bundle https://github.com/subtleGradient/Java-Velocity.tmbundle
Primarily to add support for single-line comments

It's not an exhaustive implementation, but it's at least good enough to bother using ;)

If you notice any issues please be sure to report them!

If you're interested in taking over maintainance, do let me know.

Thanks!
